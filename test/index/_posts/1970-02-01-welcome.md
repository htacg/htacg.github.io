Welcome to HTACG
================

Founded on 2015-January-15, the HTML Tidy Advocacy Community Group (“HTACG”) is
the development group now responsible for the continued support, development,
and evolution of **HTML Tidy**, the venerable command line application and
library that cleans, diagnoses, and pretty-prints your HTML.

Since its early development and release by [Dave Raggett][1], **HTML Tidy** has
matured and become the de facto, go-to tool for HTML diagnosis and pretty
printing. HTACG is charged with ensuring its continued legacy.

Please feel free to join the community and participate in HTACG’s future. You
can discover more at our [W3C Community Group][2] page.
