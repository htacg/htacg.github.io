Welcome to HTACG
================

Founded on 2015-January-15, the HTML Tidy Advocacy Community Group (“HTACG”) is
the development group now responsible for the continued support, development,
and evolution of **HTML Tidy**, the venerable command line application and
library that cleans, diagnoses, and pretty-prints your HTML.

Since its early development and release by [Dave Raggett][1], **HTML Tidy** has
matured and become the de facto, go-to tool for HTML diagnosis and pretty
printing. HTACG is charged with ensuring its continued legacy.

Please feel free to join the community and participate in HTACG’s future. You
can discover more at our [W3C Community Group][2] page.


FAQs
----

### Where can I get a copy of HTML Tidy?

It’s probable that you already have an outdated version of **HTML Tidy**. It
comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and many distributions of GNU/Linux and other
UNIX-type operating systems.

Visit [HTML Tidy’s own website][3] or access the source code on our
[Github repository](4) for more up-to-date versions.


### Where can I learn more about HTML Tidy?

Visit [HTML Tidy’s own website][3] or access the source code on our
[Github repository][4]. You can also learn a lot more background on Tidy’s
history at [tidy.sourceforge.net][5] and [Dave Ragetts’s original page][1].


### How do you pronounce your acronym?

You can pronounce the individual letters in your native language, although it
seems easier to pronounce it like “H-Task.”
